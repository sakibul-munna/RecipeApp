Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook until the strawberries offer zero resistance when pierced with a fork, about 7 minutes Using a fine mesh strainer, strain into a non-reactive bowl and discard strawberries. The syrup will be clear, ruby red in color, sweet, and full of strawberry flavor. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes before using.2)Make the whipped cream:In a medium bowl combine the heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Using a hand mixer, start whipping the cream on low speed. Gradually turn up the speed to medium and whip until the heavy cream is at stiff peaks, about 90 seconds.The whipped cream on the beater should remain in place and not droop, this is called stiff peaks. Be careful not to whip too long or the cream will turn to butter! Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.3)Make the Italian soda and serve:Pour 1/3 cup strawberry syrup and the lemon juice in a glass measuring cup and stir to combinePour the mixture over a tall glass filled halfway with ice.

      recipe: "1)Heat the water: Fill a pot with water and place your immersion circulator inside. Set the temperature to 158°F and let the water come up to temperature.2)Prep the chicken:Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and place them in a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag with the lemon arranged over top.Make sure the chicken is in a single layer. If you need to use two bags, that’s better than having overlapping chicken pieces.3)Seal the bag:Seal the bag with as little air as possible by using the water-displacement method to press out all the air: Just slowly lower the bag with the chicken into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air out of the bag. Once the top of the bag reaches the waterline and all the air has been pressed out, seal the bag. (Read more here.)You can do this in the pot of water as it heats. (Just be careful if the water is already steaming!)Set the chicken aside on a kitchen towel until the water has finished heating. At this point, you can also freeze the bag if you want to store the prepared chicken for later.4)Prepare the broccoli:Place the florets in a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag, and season with red pepper flakes and sesame oil. To weigh the broccoli down, add a few heavy soup spoons to the bag (or plan to place a heavy bowl over the top of the water bath to keep the broccoli submerged).Use the same water displacement technique to seal the broccoli bag.5)Cook the broccoli and chicken:Once the water has come to temperature, add the chicken and broccoli to the water and cook for 2 hours. Make sure your cooking bags are completely submerged in the water; place a heavy bowl over the pot if the spoons aren't keeping the broccoli submerged.I also like to rotate all the bags halfway through cooking to make sure they are cooking evenly, as sometimes they can get jostled around in the water.When cooking time ends, remove from the water and turn off the circulator.6)Serve the chicken:Remove the chicken and broccoli and portion in lunch-sized portions or serve for dinner.",

      title: "French Omelette",
      details: "French omelettes have a reputation for being difficult to make, but with a little practice and just the right amount of confidence, we know you can nail it!",
      recipe: "1)Beat the eggs:In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until no traces of white remain. Whisk in the salt and white pepper. 2)Melt the butter:In an 8-inch nonstick skillet with rounded sides set over medium heat, melt the butter, being careful not to let it brown. Swirl it around in the pan so it coats the bottom and sides.3)Cook the eggs:Pour the eggs into the pan. With the bowl of a fork, tines facing up, rapidly stir the eggs. If you’re concerned about scraping the nonstick surface of your pan, use a plastic fork. Move the fork all around the pan to break up the eggs as they cook. At the same time, hold the handle of the pan with the other hand and vigorously shake the pan back and forth.If the eggs cook too fast, forming large clumps, take the pan off the heat and keep stirring. The eggs will continue to cook a little from the residual heat. Cook until the eggs are loose and creamy with small curds. This will only take 2 to 3 minutes.4)Roll the omelette:If you haven’t already done so, remove the pan from the heat. Run the fork around the edges to release the eggs. Tilt the pan to a 45-degree angle so that the eggs move to one side of the pan. Keep the pan tilted and fold the eggs toward the edge until you have a half moon shape, running the fork under and around the eggs as needed to loosen them from the pan.With the pan still tilted, sharply tap the handle 2 or 3 times with your free hand to push the eggs over the edge by about 2 inches. If this makes no sense, that’s okay—use a spatula to gently coax the eggs about 2 inches over the edge of the pan. Use your fork to fold the overhanging eggs up and towards the center of the omelette. It should now be almond-shaped.5)Transfer the omelette onto a plate:Hold onto the handle as close to the pan as possible. Bang the still tilted pan on the counter to move the omelette right up to the edge of the pan. Tilt a plate right next to the omelette and tip it onto the plate so the seam is on the bottom.6)Serve the omelette:Sprinkle with chives or parsley, if you’d like, and serve.",

      title: "Homemade French Fries",
      details: "French fry lovers rejoice! These classic French fries are deep-fried twice to ensure a crispy outside and a fluffy interior. It’s exactly what you want in a fry.",
      recipe: "1)Prep the potatoes: Fill a large bowl with cold water and set aside. If desired, use a vegetable peeler to peel the potatoes. Use a mandolin or a knife to cut fries into 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch thick cuts, depending on your preference. I prefer 1/4-inches as I find they stay the crispiest.To cut by hand, slice the edge off one side of the potato to create a flat surface. Place the flattened side down, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch thick slices. Cut each slice into 1/4-inch to 3/8-inch sticks.2)Rinse the fries: Place the cut fries into the water, then drain them into a sieve. Rinse the potatoes under cold water for a few seconds to help remove any excess starch.3)Soak the fries:Place the fries back into the bowl and fill with cold water until they are fully submerged. Add in the white vinegar. Let the fries soak for at least 2 hours at room temperature, up to overnight (if soaking longer than 2 hours, store in the fridge).4)Drain the potatoes and arrange on baking sheet: Line two large baking sheets with two layers of paper towels or clean kitchen towels. Drain the potatoes using a strainer, then transfer them to the baking sheet. Arrange them evenly on the baking sheet and place another kitchen towel or paper towel on top to blot any excess moisture. Let the fries drain and air-dry for at least 15 minutes up to an hour—the drier the potatoes, the better the result.5)Fry the potatoes: Line a baking sheet with paper towels or a kitchen towel to drain excess grease from fries after frying. Meanwhile, set a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add at least 2 inches of oil to the pot. Use a thermometer to heat oil to 300°F.In batches, cook the fries for 3 to 5 minutes or until the fries are tender. You may need to cook them in 2 -3 batches. Use a slotted spoon or kitchen spider to remove the fries from the oil and drain on baking sheet with paper towels or a kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining fries, making sure the oil is at 300°F between batches when frying.6)Drain the potatoes:Let fries drain on the baking sheet lined with paper towels for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the oil on medium heat to 375°F.7)Fry the potatoes: Place 2 teaspoons of salt in a small bowl for easy access. Line a large baking sheet or plate with paper towels. In batches, cook the fries once more for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are a light golden brown. Fries should also feel crispy (and not soggy). To test this, use a slotted spoon or spider to remove a fry from the oil and place it on the paper towel. Let cool slightly, then taste the fry—if it's still soft, continue frying. Once done, remove the remaining fries with a slotted spoon or spider and drain on the paper towel lined baking sheet. Immediately season with salt, to taste. Repeat with the remaining batches and serve while hot.8)Storage:Store leftover French fries wrapped in aluminum foil or an airtight container in the refrigerator. In the fridge, cooked fries will last up to 3 days.",

      details: "Toss penne with a creamy jerk-infused sauce for this Jamaican pasta dish. Bell peppers lend color. We add chicken, but try shrimp, too!",
      recipe: "1)Boil the water to cook the pasta:Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add salt to the water to help flavor the pasta as it cooks. (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water.)2)Make the green seasoning: In a food processor add the onion, garlic, Scotch bonnet or habanero pepper, thyme, and water. Pulse until the texture is slightly smooth and thick.3)Prep the chicken:Put the chicken pieces into a large mixing bowl. Roll the lime on the countertop to soften. Slice in half and squeeze the juice over the chicken. You can mix the lime halves with the chicken and leave it until you’re ready to rinse. Fill the bowl with water just until it covers the chicken. Using a wooden spoon or tongs, stir the chicken. Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit in the acidic water for 15-20 minutes.4)Rinse the chicken and pat dry: Gently drain the water out of the bowl. Fill the bowl of chicken with fresh cold water and gently drain again. Repeat this process twice to remove the lime and any slime the chicken might have. Pat chicken dry with paper towels.5)Season and marinate the chicken: Add the hot jerk seasoning, green seasoning, browning sauce, and oil to the bowl of chicken. Massage the seasoning into meat using your hands or tongs. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let the chicken marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes or up to overnight.6)Cook the pasta: Once the water has come to a rolling boil, add the dry pasta and cook, uncovered for 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep the heat at medium-high for a rolling boil. Drain pasta in a colander, add drained pasta back to the pot and drizzle in a little oil to keep from sticking while you make the sauce and cook the chicken. Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and set aside.7)Cook the chicken:Take the chicken out of the fridge, remove plastic wrap. In a deep non-stick skillet over medium heat, add 2 teaspoons of the oil. Using a pair of tongs place chicken in the pan, leaving excess marinade behind. Sauté about 10 minutes until the chicken is browned and the seasoning has dried onto the meat, turning the chicken occasionally. Chicken should read 165 degrees F if using a thermometer or juices should run clear when done. Remove from the pan and. Set aside.8)Cook the vegetables:Add a little more oil to the skillet. Add 2 more teaspoons to the skillet. Add the peppers, onion, and garlic. Sauté until tender, but still crisp, about 5 minutes. The peppers should still retain their color and not look dull. If you pierce with a fork the pepper should still have some give to it. Add the chicken back into the pan with the vegetables and toss to combine.9)Make the sauce:Add the heavy cream, salt, black pepper, and paprika. Let the cream simmer for 5 minutes. You’ll know it’s simmering when small bubbles appear on the surface. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until the cheese melts.10)Remove from the heat and rest a bit, then serve:Remove from the heat and let the pasta rest for 2 minutes so the pasta can absorb the flavors of the sauce. Serve hot!  Store leftover pasta in an airtight container with a lid in the fridge for up to 3 days. When reheating, I recommend not overheating because the cheese can melt too much and become oily.",

      recipe: "1)Make the orange sauce: Whisk together sauce ingredients in a medium bowl. Set aside. 2)Prep the chicken:Cut chicken into about 1-inch cubes. Whisk eggs with salt and black pepper in a bowl and add chicken. Stir together.In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and cornstarch. Remove chicken from eggs with a slotted spoon or tongs, letting excess egg drain off, then transfer to cornstarch mixture and coat well. 3)Fry the chicken: Add oil to a large 10- to 12-inch skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350 ̊F. If you don’t have a thermometer, you can also test the temperature by sprinkling in some flour and it should fizzle immediately.Once oil is hot, fry the chicken in two batches. The oil might not completely cover the chicken—that’s okay. Cook for 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 4 more minutes. Total cook time is about 6-8 minutes.Remove fried chicken cubes and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, so the chicken can drain. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked. 4)Simmer the chicken in the sauce: Once chicken is done, pour out hot oil and wipe pan clean. Add a fresh tablespoon of oil along with chopped garlic and shallot. Cook for a minute and then add the sauce. Simmer the sauce until it starts to thicken.Once the sauce is lightly bubbling, add fried chicken and toss together to coat. The sauce should continue to thicken and stick to the chicken. Let simmer for a minute or two more. Serve orange chicken over cooked white rice, garnished with sesame seeds and fresh scallions.",

      recipe: "1)Zest the lemon: Use a vegetable peeler to remove strips of lemon skin from the lemon. Don’t dig in too deeply. You only want the yellow outer portion of the skin, leaving most of the white pith on the lemon.Juice the lemons and measure out 2 tablespoons of juice (save the remaining juice for another use). Set zest aside to make the simple syrup. 2)Prep and macerate the strawberries: Slice half of the strawberries (1 pound) into quarters and toss them with 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice in a medium sized bowl.Set aside on the counter and let macerate for 30 minutes or up to 2 hours while you make the Basil Simple Syrup. 3)Make the basil simple syrup: Combine 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat.

Puree, then strain the puree.

Add two bottles of Prosecco, the sliced strawberries, fresh basil leaves, and the lemon peels from the simple syrup. Stir again. 6)Serve and garnish: Pour the sangria into glasses filled with ice, and top with one fresh basil leaf.For the strawberry garnish, make a small cut down the center of a small strawberry, leaving the stem intact at the top. Slip the strawberry onto the rim of your glass.Serve as is, or top with club soda to soften the sweetness of the drink or dilute the alcohol content.",

      recipe: "1)Prepare a bowl: Lightly grease a large bowl with a little bit of oil. You will put your dough in this bowl to let it rise. Set the bowl aside. 2)Prepare the dough: In a liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. The milk should be just warm to the touch. If it’s too hot you can kill the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes.In another large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add yogurt, oil and milk-yeast mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the dough. The dough should be soft and sticky at this point. 3)Knead the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Transfer the dough to the counter. Knead together until a soft dough forms, about 5 minutes. If the dough feels dry and is too tough to knead, add about 1-2 tablespoons of water, a little bit at a time, until the dough is easier to work with. 4)Let the dough rise: Transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place in a dark, warm, dry place. I place it in my oven (it’s not on) to let it rise, but your countertop is fine. Let the dough rise for 3-4 hours or until it more than doubles in size. 5)Punch down the dough and let it rise again: Punch the risen dough down. Knead for another minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover it again and let it rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour. 6)Divide the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for another minute or two until it's smooth. Divide the dough into 16 smaller balls of equal size (about 2 ounces each).Using a rolling pin, roll the balls into a teardrop shape. About 2-3 inches wide, 6-7 inches long, and about 1/8 inch thick. They don’t have to be perfectly uniform. 7)Cook the naan: If using herbs or spices, sprinkle one side of the bread with those now. Brush the other side with water. Set a medium-sized heavy pan or cast iron skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.Check the heat of the pan by flicking water on it. If it evaporates on contact, it’s ready. Once the pan is hot, place the naan wet side down into the skillet.Cover it with a lid. Let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles on it. Flip the naan, brush it with butter or ghee, and cook it uncovered for another 10 seconds. Serve it hot.",

      recipe: "1)Clean and trim the mushrooms: Use a damp sponge or paper towel to gently scrub off any visible dirt on the mushrooms. Slice off any woody or soft ends from your mushrooms with a knife and place them into a large mixing bowl. 2)Prepare the batter: Add the beer, buttermilk, soy sauce, and cracked egg into a medium bowl and whisk together until fully combined. Use a sieve to sift in 1 cup of the all-purpose flour, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk the batter until no lumps remain and set aside. 3)Heat the oil: Add the canola oil to a clean, dry Dutch oven or other heavy-bottom frying vessel, using just enough to fill the vessel with 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium-high until the temperature reaches 350°F using an instant-read or candy thermometer, then adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature. 4)Prepare the battering and frying stations: Add the panko to a small bowl and set it next to the batter, then place a baking sheet with a wire rack next to your frying station. Alternatively, you can line the baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Set aside a clean plate to place the breaded mushrooms on. 5)Coat the mushrooms: Toss the mushrooms with the remaining 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour until each mushroom has an even, thin layer of flour coating it. Dip each floured mushroom into the beer batter, let the excess drip off, then toss in the panko breadcrumbs until evenly coated. Remove to a clean plate and repeat with the remaining mushrooms. 6)Fry the mushrooms: Carefully add the first 10 mushrooms to the hot oil, adjusting heat as necessary to keep the oil temperature as close as possible to 350°F throughout the frying process. Allow them to fry for 2-4 minutes, or until the bottoms are deeply golden brown, then use a spider or slotted spoon to carefully flip each mushroom. Fry the other side for another 2-4 minutes, or until each mushroom is evenly golden brown. Using your spider or slotted spoon, remove the fried mushrooms to your wire rack or paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle liberally with flaky salt. Repeat, in batches of 10 mushrooms, until all the mushrooms are fried — likely twice more. 7)Serve the fried mushrooms: Allow the final batch of fried mushrooms to cool for 5 minutes, then plate all the mushrooms on a large plate or serving platter. Sprinkle with more flaky salt as needed, and scatter fresh thyme leaves throughout. ",

Toss to combine. 3)Drain the filling: Place a large colander over a large bowl. Transfer the filling into the colander and allow it to drain and fully cool. 4)Set up a wrapping station: Lightly sprinkle flour on a large tray or baking sheet. This will ensure the egg rolls don’t stick to the tray. Fill a small bowl with water for sealing the egg rolls and set it next to the tray. 5)Fill the egg rolls: Place one wrapper flat on a cutting board or the kitchen counter with one of the corners towards you, so it looks like a diamond. Keep the remaining wrappers covered with a kitchen towel so that they don’t dry out.Place a loosely packed 1/2 cup of filling off-center near the corner closest to you. 6)Roll the egg rolls: Fold the corner closest to you over the filling. Fold the two side corners inwards so it looks like an envelope.Dip your finger into the prepared water and wet the top corner. Roll the egg roll from the filling side upwards. Place the egg roll on the prepared tray seam-side down.Repeat with the remaining wrappers, lining up the egg rolls on the tray in a single layer. 7)Heat frying oil: Set a wire rack over a baking sheet. You will be placing the fried egg rolls on the rack. This allows the egg rolls to cool without steaming and getting soggy.In a medium pot, add enough oil to come about 2 inches up the sides of the pot. Heat the oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 325°F. If you don’t have a deep-fry thermometer, you can test the temperature. 8)Fry the egg rolls: To test the oil temperature, carefully place one or two egg rolls into the oil. The oil should bubble up around the egg rolls. If it doesn’t, increase the heat. Fry for about 5 minutes until golden brown. Keep them moving in the oil using long wooden chopsticks or tongs to make sure they fry evenly.Transfer the fried egg roll onto the prepared rack to drain, leaving space between each so that they don’t steam and become soggy.Repeat with the rest of the egg rolls, frying about 5 or so at a time, depending on the size of your pot. You want enough space between each egg roll for them to float around freely without touching each other for even cooking. 9)Serve: Serve the egg rolls warm, but not burn-your-mouth hot, with a side of Chinese hot mustard, duck sauce, or chili sauce.",

Add the lid and shake well to combine all of the ingredients. Set aside. The vinaigrette can be made in advance and stored in the fridge. It’s best served at room temperature. If you have leftover dressing, it will keep fine in the fridge for a week. 3)Grill the vegetables:  Drizzle the peppers and onions with olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and using tongs add to your preheated grill. Grill the vegetables for 4-5 minutes per side until they are well charred and tender. Using tongs, remove from the grill and let cool. Roughly chop the vegetables for the salad. 4)Prep and season the shrimp:  In a large bowl, add the shrimp. Drizzle with olive oil and season with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Then skewer the shrimp, dividing them between 4 skewers. If you use wooden/bamboo skewers, make sure to soak them well so they don’t burn completely on the grill. 5)Grill the shrimp: Add shrimp skewers to grill (I recommend lightly oiling grill to prevent sticking) and grill for 2-3 minutes per side. The shrimp are done when they are pink and no longer translucent in the center. Remove shrimp from grill and serve them as soon as possible. 6)Assemble the salad and serve:  Add the romaine lettuce into a large serving plate or bowl and drizzle with a tablespoon or two of the vinaigrette. Top with chopped, grilled vegetables, grilled shrimp, sweet corn, avocado, cherry tomatoes, scallions, and crumbled Cotija cheese.Serve. 7)Storage: Leftover salad ingredients are best stored separately and without dressing. Shrimp will keep in the fridge for 2-3 days. If you do have salad that is dressed, it will keep okay for 1 day in the fridge, but the texture will change. ",

      recipe: "1)Soak the rice: Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh sieve, combing through the grains with your fingers, until water appears almost clear, about 1 minute. Pour enough cold water into the bowl to submerge the rice completely. Add the rice and soak rice for at least 30 minutes up to 4 hours. Drain the rice through a sieve and set aside until ready to cook. 2)Sauté the aromatics: Set a medium 3-quart pot over medium heat. Add oil, and stir in cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, fennel seeds, and black peppercorns. Once the spices begin to sizzle, stir in onion. Sauté the onions for 8 to 10 minutes or until golden-brown at the edges and soft and translucent in the middle. Season with 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt. Stir frequently to prevent them from burning. Lower the heat to medium-low, then sauté the garlic, ginger, jalapeno halves, and cashews (if using) for 1 to 2 minutes, or until aromatic. 3)Cook the tomato: Add the tomato, garam masala, and cumin. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes until the tomato liquid has reduced slightly and begins sticking to the pan. 4)Boil the rice: Add the water, drained rice, and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Bring the mixture to a boil, uncovered. Let the mixture boil until craters (pea-sized bubbles) form on the top, about 5 minutes. Stir the rice once (you may notice the bottom of the rice is sticking slightly to the pan; carefully stir to loosen any stuck grains). 5)Finish cooking the rice: If using a gas stove, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 20 minutes. Turn the heat off, then let the rice sit for 10 minutes, covered. Remove the lid and fluff the rice with a fork. With the fork, sift through and discard any whole spices. 6)Serve: Garnish rice with cilantro and serve.",

      details: "A take-out favorite comes home for dinner. Here's our version of Pad Thai with chicken. A little prep goes a long way and makes this dish an easy stovetop dinner. You can do this!",
      recipe: "1)Soak the rice noodles: In a large container, preferably one with a lid, soak the noodles in cold water, enough to cover so that no noodle is poking out. Soak for at least 2 hours or up to 12 hours. It can be refrigerated, or not—it doesn’t matter. 2)Make the sauce: In a shallow bowl, whisk together the fish sauce, rice vinegar, tamarind concentrate, and sugar until smooth. Taste. Adjust the sauce as needed. Add a pinch of paprika or cayenne powder for color.You’ll only need about 1/2 cup of sauce for this recipe (1/4 cup per batch). Any extra sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to three months—and/or used on leftovers to spruce them up during reheating. 3)Bring a large pot of water to boil 4)Divide all of your ingredients into two batches: Arrange them near your stove. You’ll prepare each batch completely, one after the next.   WORKING ONE BATCH AT A TIME.  5)Cook the eggs: Heat a wok or other large pan with high sides over high heat, which you will maintain throughout cooking the pad Thai. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of oil. When the oil starts to shimmer a bit, it’s ready.Crack the eggs for this batch into the pan, and using the tip of a wooden spoon, gently loosen the yolk. You want to have enough oil in the pan so it looks as though the egg is floating, or suspended, in the oil. This gives you more surface area to cook the egg without it burning.Gently shake and flip the egg around in the pan. Break it up a bit with the spoon, but don’t scramble it by any means. This should take about a minute. Push the eggs off to the side of the pan to make room for the chicken. 6)Cook the chicken: If the pan seems too dry because the eggs have absorbed all of the oil (not likely, but possible), add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil to the pan. Add the chicken for this batch. Cook the chicken for 4 to 5 minutes, turning to make sure it cooks most of the way through. 7)Soften the noodles: Take several handfuls of your noodles (about half the total amount) out of the water they’re soaking in, and transfer to a fine mesh sieve. Hold the sieve over the pot of hot water and gently dip the noodles up and down, in and out of the water, to soften them but not cook them per se. (Using the sieve saves you from having to cook and then strain the noodles—and makes the process move more quickly.)Shake out the excess hot water and taste to make sure the noodles have softened but still have a little give. 8)Add the noodles to the pan:Transfer the noodles to the hot pan; they don’t need to be completely cooked at this point, because they will continue to cook in the wok.Toss them gently in the pan and stir them briefly to keep them from sticking together. When the noodles look shiny, it’s time for the sauce. 9)Add the sauce: Add about 1/4 cup of the sauce to the pan, and gently toss and flip the noodles in the pan. Stir them quickly to integrate the sauce; you’ll know it’s ready when you can’t see any more sauce in the pan because the noodles have absorbed it. If it seems like it needs more, add a little more, and cook until it’s absorbed. Taste. 10)Add the peanuts and bean sprouts: Add the peanuts and the sprouts, and toss all ingredients together quickly. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes altogether until everything is heated through. The noodles will begin to soften and look more translucent. 11)Taste and serve: Turn the heat off the pan and taste the to make sure there is enough sauce to flavor the dish. Serve immediately in individual bowls with wedges of lime, along with additional peanuts, chopped cilantro, and/or red pepper flakes, if desired. 12)Repeat steps 5 through 11 for making the second batch of pad Thai",

Cover with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 8 to 24 hours. 2)Make the flour coating for chicken: In a large plastic bag or in a large bowl combine the flour, piri piri spice blend, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. 3)Dredge the chicken pieces in flour mixture: Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and allow the excess buttermilk to drip off. Individually dredge each piece into the flour mixture making sure the chicken is fully coated. Shake off the excess flour, place the chicken pieces on a sheet pan. 4)Let the floured chicken rest: Let the floured chicken pieces sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to help the flour adhere to the chicken and let the chicken come to room temperature. 5)Heat the frying oil: While the chicken sits for 30 minutes, fill the Dutch oven half way full with oil. Heat the oil, over medium-high heat until the oil reaches 325°F when using a kitchen thermometer.Alternatively, to tell if your oil is ready for frying you can add a pinch of flour into the oil, and when it begins to sizzle, your oil is ready. 6)Fry the chicken: Cook the chicken in batches by adding a few pieces of chicken to the pot and fry for about 15 minutes, turning halfway through the cooking time. Your chicken is full cooked through when the thickest part of the chicken pieces reaches 165°F when inserted with a digital thermometer. 7)Place chicken on a rack to drain excess oil: When the chicken is golden brown and cooked through, remove the chicken using tongs and place on a rack over a baking sheet to drain any excess oil. 8)Serve: Serve fried chicken warm along with your favorite sides",

      recipe: "1)Prepare the grill or smoker: You do not need a dedicated smoker! You can use a grill—either gas or charcoal—to create indirect low heat, 225ºF to 275ºF. For a gas grill: obtain indirect low heat by turning on one burner to high heat. You’ll grill the wings over the unlit burners. Add a smoker box or a perforated aluminum foil pouch filled with wood chips on top of the lit burner to generate smoke. For a charcoal grill: obtain indirect low heat by pushing unlit coals to one side. Light some coal and place the lit coals on top of unlit coals. Close the vents to reduce airflow. Add wood chunks directly to the lit coals for smoke.For a dedicated smoker: Add 3 to 4 wood chunks to the smoker. If using a water pan or kamado grill, place the chunks directly on the coals. If using a pellet smoker, use cherry wood pellets. 2)Prepare the dry rub:  In a small bowl or spice shaker, combine the salt, garlic powder, brown sugar, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, and ancho chili powder. 3)Prepare the wings: With a sharp knife or poultry shears, remove the wingtip and separate the flat and drum. Flex each joint to visualize its center, then cut through it. Save the wingtips for another use, like chicken stock. 4)Dry and season the wings:  Place the wings on a baking sheet lined with paper towels and pat dry. Discard the paper towels.Brush the wings with a light coat of olive oil. Season the wings all over with the rub. 5)Smoke the wings: Smoke the wings over indirect low heat—over the empty side of the charcoal grill or the unlit burners—for 1 hour, with the grill lid on, flipping once. Note: I got 28 to 34 chicken wings in 5 pounds. If your chicken wings are large, with less than 28 wings, smoke them for 15 minutes longer. Raise the temperature of the smoker to medium-high heat, 400º to 425º F. For a gas or charcoal grill, transfer the wings over to the lit burner or coals. Cook for 15 minutes with the lid on, then transfer onto a serving platter and serve.",
